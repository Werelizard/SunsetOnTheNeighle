# Setup and quick history check

Maregypt was a bastion of Pony culture in Zebrica. The Kingdom's influence could once be felt from the tip of the Neighle Delta down the southernmost reaches of the Neighle. However, a combination of factors - a shaky succession, war and later the devastation of the Storm King - led to the kingdom's complte decline and fall into utter poverty. King Sneighfru the Shy died, leaving only his youngest son, Khefer, to assume the throne.
