 SOTN_MgyFlavour.2.title:0 "At a Loss for Words"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.2.desc:0 "For days now, King Khefer has been churning draft after draft, his hooves clamped around his temples as he struggles to pen out yet another. It is no secret within the palace that the last few years have gradually chipped at his optimism and cheerful nature - even if he maintains a positive and friendly demeaour when in public. Attempting to write this year's speech however has been challenging to say the least; what good can a King's words truly be when foals go hungry, when crops fail, when the spirit of friendship itself seems to have deserted the land?\n\nAnd yet, he knows he cannot give up - for that is not something which a King can afford to do. And so it goes on: one more page. One more draft. One more page. One more draft. Khefer sighs, and takes a deep breath. And then he starts anew."
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.2.a:0 "I'll do my best!"

 SOTN_MgyFlavour.3.title:0 "A Helping Hand?"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.3.desc:0 "Five days. Five, long, sun-scorched days. And not a single passable draft. No matter how hard he tries, Khefer cannot weave a convincing speech together, with his words sliding off the pages as sand does off the sides of crumbling pyramids. With every failed attempt the King can feel the last ebbs of his motivation vanishing while he frenetically attempts to pen just one more line.\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door, accompanied by an all to familiar voice. 'Your Majesty, is everything alright?' Khefer lifted his head from the pile of papers and spent quills. Shaa Doof stood before him, the Vizier's dust-coloured mane swishing as the older Pony crossed the room, 'more writing troubles?'\n'None of my words are coming together, I feel I'm writing with my hooves tied together,' the King bemoaned.\nThe Vizier frowned. 'Perhaps...I might be of some help? I've penned many speeches in my time,' Shaa Doof said.\n\nThe King's gaze jumped from the discarded drafts, to his Vizier and then back to the drafts. He gave the other Pony a curt nod, and handed him his current work in progress."
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.3.a:0 "Well, I trust you Shaa Doof"

 SOTN_MgyFlavour.4.title:0 "The Big Day"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.4.desc:0 "King Khefer paced nervously in his office. The microphone stand was but a trot away, ready to come alive with a flick of the hoof. He looked at the guards posted around the room - at his faithful, ever-watchful Maredjay - as he did his best to steady his nerves whilst awaiting for Shaa Doof's finished speech. Not a moment too soon did the Vizier arrived, flanked by a group of overseers, administrators and more Mareday. With his familiar mix of solemnity and paternal courtesy, the older Pony handed Khefer a two-page folder. The King quickly perused it, attentively reviewing every word. It was a good speech. Although, perhaps, it was too good; whilst the Vizier's skill was unquestionable, it was abundantly clear that Khefer had not written it. Worse, he was not begininhg to doubt that this was the speech the populace needed to hear.\n\n'Is it to your liking?' the Vizier asked.\nThe King cast Shaa Doof back a cordial smile. 'Yes,' he replied, 'thank you.'"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.4.a:0 "Hopefully this goes well..."

 SOTN_MgyFlavour.5.title:0 "The Other Pony"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.5.desc:0 "In spite of his nerves, the King managed to press on, with his entourage praising him for his eloquence. Whilst this assuaged Khefer's anxiety to some degree, he has yet to have a good night's rest since having given the speech, waking one too many times under the pale moonlight to wander the corridors of the palace alone as he seeks the comfort of sleep. And while one would hope that public reception would turn out to be positive it was not meant to be.\n\nBoth the Iset en Heyter-Tawy alongside more radical members of the Semayt Nesut-Bity were prompt to express their dissatisfaction - albeit for very different reasons. Matters worsened when a popular workers' gazette - the Red Mare - published its own scathing takedown of the speech, criticising the lack of concrete solutions to the ongoing crisis, the King's perceived lack of awarness of commonponies' conditions as well as more broad comments aimed at the noble elite.\n\nChief among these critics is Narmare Redet - the current head of the Maregyptian People's Party. The popular author and head of the farmer's guild was quick to give his own inflamatory counter-speech, one which was met with surprise by the conservative elements of society, and outstanding support by left-leaning segements of the political scene. Meanwhile, the Maredjay have struggled to keep the peace as riots over spoilt bread broke out in the capital streets."
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.5.a:0 "Why can't we just get along?"

 SOTN_MgyFlavour.6.title:0 "A Neigh and then Silence"
 SOTN_MgyFlavour.6.desc:0 "The last few days were stressful for the King to say the least. Unrest spread outwards and into the provinces, as local Nomarchs implored the crown for help. In response, the King ordered the Maredjay to stand down and let local authorities handle this as he prepared a second speech - all the while concerting with his cabinet on how best to help his people and smooth the situation over. It seems however that the Maredjay's Lady-Captain - Ahhotep - opted to disobey the King's direct orders as she organised a nation-wide crackdown and placed Narmare Redet under house arrest. Throught the country, the Maredjay moved in the dark, arresting or intimidating perceived sympathisers to the socialist cause. Whilst this had the intended effect of eroding the Maregyptian People's Party's popular base, it also served to vindicate the people's anger and radicalise those that remain. When ordered to return to the capital to justify herself before the King, the Lady-Captain declined, stating that she was doing her duty to crown and country."
