 SOTN_FadingSun:0 "The Fading Sun"
 SOTN_FadingSun_desc:0 "Maregypt is no longer the realm it was. Once, it was the envy of all of Zebrica - a beacon of Harmony and prosperity for all. Now it is but a ruin, a blend of urban sprawl, disaffected estates and run-down farmland admist a field of millenia-old pyramids, temples and desert.
